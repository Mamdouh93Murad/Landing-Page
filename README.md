# Landing Page Project
This is a Project Part of FWD-Scholarship for Web Development Professional Track. 
HTML was used to add sections to the page-structure
then by using Document/Element/Interface properities through JavaScript to build a Dynamic Website. 
    function buildList() {
        ....
    });
}

    This Function builds a ul-navbar-elements depending on how many sections there are in the page.

    Then I add a little of Fancy effects that, when we were are viewing a specific section in the page, the according section in navbar is highlighted 
    
    function activateLink() {
   .....
  }

  and then I use event-listener function to listen to clicks on the navbar sections to directly scroll in a smooth style to the correpsonding part of the page

  function scroll() {
    .....  
    }

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
